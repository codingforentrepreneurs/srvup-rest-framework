For http test server. This is only if you need to test a raw HTML 
index file as a test server. The goal here is to install the node  
& javascript package manager to get the package "http-server" in 
order to emmulate a server so ajax requests work in a local 
testing environment.


Quick way for all: https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm


Suggested way for mac users:

1. Install homebrew via http://brew.sh/
-> ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2. Install Node.js and the Javascript Package Manager (npm) via homebrew:
-> sudo brew install npm 
*note: need computer admin rights for "sudo"
3. Install "http-server" via npm.
-> sudo npm install http-server -g


"->" denotes terminal commands.
